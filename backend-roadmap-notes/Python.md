# Sending commands to Python

You can send commands to python via:

```python
python3 -c "print('Nossa!')"
```

the `-c`  is the `cmd` flag, which allows a program to be passed in as string (terminates option list).

# Running a module as a script

You can run a module as a script using the command
```python
python3 -m site
```

# REPL

`REPL` is an acronym for Read-Eval-Print Loop. Developers use `REPL` Python to communicate with the Python Interpreter. You can input commands in the `REPL`  and see the results displayed immediately.

To access it you can simply run `python3`


# Shebang

 It is a good practice to start your script file with a shebang as it will tell the operating system which interpreter to use to parse the script. Note that is valuable for any language your might be running your script, therefore it is not something particular to Python.
